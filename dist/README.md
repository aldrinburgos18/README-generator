The user will enter a city to perform the search. Clicking on the button will display the information. The entered city will be momentarily registered in a button, and you can search for as many cities as you want. If the user wants to see the weather conditions of a previously searched city, they can click on the registered city and the information will be displayed again. The UV Index parameter shows the value together with a color that represents favorable (green), moderate (orange) or severe (red).
